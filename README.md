A Minecraft cheat that runs as a Forge mod.

## Installing

1. Download the latest version of [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) for the corresponding ForgeHax Minecraft version (this is important if you want to run older versions of ForgeHax).
2. Download the latest ForgeHax build by going to the [lanzamientos](https://github.com/ug50/ForgeHax/releases).section. Do NOT install the jar that contains sources. That one contains the source code and isn't compiled.
3. Place the ForgeHax jar into the .minecraft/mods/ directory. If you want to organize by Minecraft version, you can place it under .minecraft/mods/{mc.version} where mc.version is the version of Minecraft running (ex: .minecraft/mods/1.12.2). NOTE: This is will not work for 1.13+ version! You can only put the mod jar in the /mods folder!
4. Launch Minecraft using the Forge profile. ForgeHax should now be loaded.
